## Background

In this section we will take the data we have registered and transformed with AWS Glue and use QuickSight to visualize the results. You will become familiar with the QuickSight interface and build a few charts with the data to discover team and quarterback stats.

## Implementation Instructions

:heavy_exclamation_mark: Ensure you've completed the [Transform Data][transform-data] step before beginning

Each of the following sections provides an implementation overview and detailed, step-by-step instructions. The overview should provide enough context for you to complete the implementation if you're already familiar with the AWS Management Console or if you want to explore the services yourself without following a walkthrough.
