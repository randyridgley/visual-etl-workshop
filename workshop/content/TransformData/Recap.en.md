### :star: Recap

:key: [AWS Glue Studio][studio] makes ETL accessible to the many users who are new to Apache Spark programming and to users who are accustomed to ETL tools with boxes-and-arrows interfaces. Without writing code, users of all experience levels can now take advantage of big data processing on AWS Glueâ€™s serverless Apache Spark-based ETL platform. They can also use the AWS Glue Studio job monitoring dashboard to get a global view of their ETL execution and resource usage.

:wrench: In this module you've used AWS Glue Studio to clean, transform, and export data into your dtaa lake either in S3 or Snowflake. Learned how to use Athena to verify results of data in your S3 data lake. Finally, reinforced adding permission to data in your data lake through AWS Lake Formation.

### Next

:white_check_mark: Now that you have data, continue on to the next section to [visualize the data][visualize] in your data lake using QuickSight.
