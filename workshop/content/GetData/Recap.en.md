:key: [AWS Data Exchange][dx] is a service that makes it easy for AWS customers to securely exchange file-based data sets in the AWS Cloud.

As a subscriber, you can find and subscribe to hundreds of products from qualified data providers. Then, you can quickly download the data set or copy it to Amazon S3 for use across a variety of AWS analytics and machine learning services. Anyone with an AWS account can be a AWS Data Exchange subscriber.

:key: [AWS Glue DataBrew][brew] is a visual data preparation tool that makes it easy for data analysts and data scientists to clean and normalize data to prepare it for analytics and machine learning. You can choose from over 250 pre-built transformations to automate data preparation tasks, all without the need to write any code. You can automate filtering anomalies, converting data to standard formats, and correcting invalid values, and other tasks. After your data is ready, you can immediately use it for analytics and machine learning projects.
