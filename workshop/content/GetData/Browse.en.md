#### Background
Getting 3rd party data has always been a challenging task looking at many external sites and pulling the data into AWS. With AWS Data Exchange you can publish and subscribe to 3rd party data and directly export it to Amazon S3. There are hundreds of available data sets ranging from public sector to media & entertainment categories that can be used to augment your existing data sets or use to build new training data sets for your AI/ML needs.

#### High-Level Instructions
In the AWS Data Exchange console, you will browse the product catalog looking for the StatsPerform NFL Data Sample Preview in order to subscribe to it in the next section. Become familiar with the UI and how to navigate the available data sets.
